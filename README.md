This repository showcases end-to-end examples of how to build, deploy, and maintain AI systems in production environments. Each project demonstrates real-world applications, covering various AI deployment strategies, including APIs, cloud services, and MLOps pipelines. Projects included:

# 1. Image Classification API with TensorFlow Serving

Build and deploy a deep learning model for image classification using TensorFlow. This project covers training the model, containerizing it with Docker, and deploying it utilizing TensorFlow Serving with a REST API for real-time predictions.

    Tools: TensorFlow, Docker, REST API, Kubernetes
    Key Topics: Model deployment, scalable API, containerization

# 2. Text Sentiment Analysis with Flask and AWS Lambda

A serverless solution for real-time text sentiment analysis. The model is deployed as a Flask app that runs on AWS Lambda, providing a lightweight, cost-effective way to handle variable traffic for text analysis.

    Tools: Flask, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, BERT
    Key Topics: Serverless architecture, cost-effective scaling, real-time inference

# 3. Recommendation System with Apache Spark

Implement a recommendation engine using collaborative filtering approaches on large datasets. This project indicates how to handle large-scale data processing by employing Apache Spark, and how to deploy the model for batch inference.

    Tools: Apache Spark, Docker, AWS EMR, Flask
    Key Topics: Distributed computing, recommendation systems, batch inference

# 4. Automated Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna

This project automates the hyperparameter tuning process for a machine-learning model using Optuna. It sets up a pipeline to tune hyperparameters regularly and retrain the model with new data.

    Tools: Optuna, Scikit-learn, Ray, MLflow
    Key Topics: Hyperparameter optimization, automated retraining, MLOps

# 5. Model Monitoring and Drift Detection in Production

A project that integrates model monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana. It includes real-time alerts for model performance degradation and strategies for detecting data drift to trigger model retraining workflows.

    Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, Docker, Scikit-learn
    Key Topics: Model monitoring, drift detection, MLOps

# 6. Scaling NLP Model Serving with FastAPI and Kubernetes

Deploy a transformer-based NLP model (e.g., BERT) for text classification with FastAPI, and scale the service using Kubernetes. This project includes load balancing and auto-scaling of API requests to ensure production-grade performance.

    Tools: FastAPI, Kubernetes, Hugging Face Transformers, NGINX
    Key Topics: Scaling APIs, Kubernetes orchestration, real-time NLP

# 7. Fraud Detection System with Streaming Data

A fraud detection system built using machine learning and streaming data processing. The model is deployed to detect fraudulent transactions in near real-time, leveraging Apache Kafka for streaming and Spark for processing.

    Tools: Apache Kafka, Spark, Docker, Python
    Key Topics: Real-time data processing, fraud detection, streaming analytics

Each project provides step-by-step instructions, code, and documentation to help you replicate the deployment process. Ideal for data scientists, ML engineers, and DevOps professionals looking to bring AI models into production environments efficiently.
